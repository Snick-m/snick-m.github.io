# [Snick-m](https://github.com/snick-m) Utilities Compilations ([See Here](https://utils.mushfiqr.com))

This repository contains various small projects and utilities I have created over the years.
I actively maintain this and add new projects and utilities that are not big enough to me to give them their own repo.
